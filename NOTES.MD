- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes 
a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. 
Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean.
 If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score
And Min-Max scaling is a way for normalizing data by rescaling or
transforming all the values into decimal values between 0 and 1 
by making the max value in the group equal to 1 and the min value
equal to 0 and transforming all other values accordingly.
And we use these methods so that all the data we have is comparable
on the same scale

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
JUnit is a Regression Testing Framework used by developers to implement unit testing in Java,
 and accelerate programming speed and increase the quality of code.

When I work with zscore and minmax scaling methods  
```
